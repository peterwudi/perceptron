PC and instruction BOTH available at the begining of the cycle, therefore the
actual clock period need to add the time of fetching insturnction from
instruction cache/memory.

V1: 463.39MHz (Slow 900mV 85C), clk set to 550MHz
calculate PC+4, PC+4+IMM16
use BTB for direct and indirect jmp

BTB 256 entries * 36 bits/entry, no BTB tags (prediction may be for a different PC but it's OK)
Each entry contains PC[31:2], bimodal not included


V2: 522.19MHz (Slow 900mV 85C), clk set to 550 MHz
No btb, only calculate PC+4 and PC+4+IMM16


V3: 449.44MHz (Slow 900mV 85C), clk set to 550MHz
calculate PC+4, PC+4+IMM16, and direct JMP
use BTB for indirect JMP


=====================================================================


baseline BTB+bimodal, no calculation: 360.49MHz
BTB size 36*256, 1 "byte" = 9 bits
carry lower 9 bits in the pipeline, the last 6 bits are bimodal bits
PC = taken ? BTB result : PC+4


baseline with 512/1024/2048 entry BTB has same fmax 360.49MHz
PC available to insnMem and BTB at the same time. Insn has to be
pre-decoded to determine if it's a branch, therefore it's the
critical path.
